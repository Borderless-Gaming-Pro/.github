## What is Borderless Gaming?

**Borderless Gaming** is an advanced software solution designed to transform traditional fullscreen or windowed games into seamless **borderless windowed mode**.

With Borderless Gaming, users can experience:
- Instant transitions between gaming and other applications
- Stable, non-minimizing game windows during operation
- Enhanced compatibility for streaming and content creation workflows
- Improved multi-monitor setup integration
- Reduced input lag compared to traditional windowed mode

The software maintains extensive compatibility with virtually all PC games and has become particularly popular among players of titles such as **Minecraft**, **Metro Exodus**, **Cyberpunk 2077**, **Elden Ring**, and numerous other AAA and indie games. By streamlining the process of creating and managing borderless windows, it ensures that gamers can maintain complete focus on their gameplay experience without unnecessary distractions or technical interruptions.

Its open-source foundation and completely free availability make Borderless Gaming a trusted and reliable choice for both casual players and professional gamers. Whether you're a content streamer requiring seamless application switching, a competitive gamer needing stable performance, or simply someone who values efficient multitasking capabilities, this software provides a comprehensive and robust solution that enhances the overall gaming experience on Windows platforms.
